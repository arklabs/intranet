Diem is a content management framework (CMF) for PHP projects.

As a framework,
---------------
Diem is flexible. There is no preinstalled stuff ( blog, comments... ) : the project starts empty.
The developer creates its own modules by declaring them in configuration files.
Then Diem generates a code which is 100% specific to the site's needs.

As a CMS,
---------
Diem packages many site-independant features in a clean user interface.
Most of the common problems a web developer has to face up are made easy.

Diem is, and will always be, entirely free and published under the MIT license.
