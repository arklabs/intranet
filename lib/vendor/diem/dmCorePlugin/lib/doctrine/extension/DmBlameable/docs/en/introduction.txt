The `Blameable` extension is a behaviour which adds an additional level of auditing capabilities to any model you want.  In an environment with many users, Blameable allows you to track who created or last updated any model which has the Blameable behaviour enabled.  Blameable is a great companion to Timestampable and is the icing on the cake to the Timestampable / Versionable / SoftDelete trifecta of paranoia.
